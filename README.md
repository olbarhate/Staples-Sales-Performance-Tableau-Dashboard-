# Staples-Sales-Performance-Tableau-Dashboard-

I created an interactive Tableau sales dashboard to deliver actionable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs). This dashboard incorporates advanced Tableau features, including Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, calculated fields, parameters, sets, and groups, to enhance its functionality and interactivity. 

Dynamic visualizations display sales and profit comparisons between the selected year and the previous year, enabling stakeholders to analyze trends effectively. Intuitive charts highlight year-over-year performance, making it easier to identify growth opportunities and address challenges. A user-friendly filter button positioned at the top-right ensures quick customization, allowing users to explore the data effortlessly. This design empowers stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions with confidence.
